        <p>
            I have to pay to host this. It costs Â£10 a month. I would like to cover that cost.
            It also cost me time to build, and will cost more time to maintain.
            I do intend to keep the ads as unobtrusive as possible.
            If you want to buy me something (likely unhealthy) please do feel free to donate.
        </p>
